# ImgSeeder 4.4.1 Release Notes

ImgSeeder and `iorg` 4.4.1 participate in the synchronized eight-package
delivery of accepted
[`CR037_AIA_to_RAIkeep_RaidSeeder_Diagram_Artifact_Management.md`](https://github.com/Burkhardt/RAIkeep/blob/main/doc/CR037_AIA_to_RAIkeep_RaidSeeder_Diagram_Artifact_Management.md).
They implement accepted
[`CR037.1_AIA_to_RAIkeep_CLI_Global_Flag_and_Verb_Dispatch_Resilience.md`](https://github.com/Burkhardt/RAIkeep/blob/main/doc/CR037.1_AIA_to_RAIkeep_CLI_Global_Flag_and_Verb_Dispatch_Resilience.md).
The synchronized release also carries accepted
[`CR040_AIA_to_RAIkeep_and_jsonpit_Prohibit-Read-Modify-Write.md`](https://github.com/Burkhardt/RAIkeep/blob/main/doc/CR040_AIA_to_RAIkeep_and_jsonpit_Prohibit-Read-Modify-Write.md)
and
[`CR041_jsonpit_to_RAIkeep_Restore-Clean-Change-Filenames.md`](https://github.com/Burkhardt/RAIkeep/blob/main/doc/CR041_jsonpit_to_RAIkeep_Restore-Clean-Change-Filenames.md);
those changes are implemented in JsonPit and PitSeeder.

Existing image discovery, movement, organization, cleanup, and ItemTree
addressing remain intact. Fallback dependencies and CLI version output align to
4.4.1. A misplaced reserved verb now exits `2` with an actionable command-first
correction before ImageTree access, and version flags take immediate precedence.
