# PitSeeder

PitSeeder is a .NET command-line tool for seeding JsonPit data stores from JSON and JSON5 source files.

Within this repository, PitSeeder lives under `RAIkeep/PitSeeder` so it can build against the local `JsonPit` and `OsLib` sources before those packages are published.

It supports both:

- installation as a `dotnet tool` from NuGet
- self-contained binary publishing for macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Features

- seed a single JsonPit from one JSON or JSON5 file
- seed a set of WWWA pits in one run: Person, Object, Place, and Activity
- install as a `dotnet tool`
- publish as self-contained binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Install

After the package is published to NuGet:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global PitSeeder
```

On macOS or Linux, a more practical option is often to install the tool directly into a directory that is already on your `PATH`, for example `/usr/local/bin`:

```bash
sudo dotnet tool install PitSeeder --tool-path /usr/local/bin
```

Run:

```bash
pits --help
```

This installation method requires a compatible .NET runtime or SDK on the target machine.

To update a `--tool-path` installation:

```bash
sudo dotnet tool update PitSeeder --tool-path /usr/local/bin
```

## Quick Usage

Seed a single pit:

```bash
pits -s ./pits/sample/Person.json5 -d ./output/Person.pit
```

Seed the WWWA set:

```bash
pits -s ./pits/sample -d ./output --wwwa
```

## Build And Publish

See [BuildFromSource.md](BuildFromSource.md) for:

- building from source
- building inside the `RAIkeep` workspace against local projects
- packing and publishing the NuGet tool
- publishing self-contained binaries for macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows
